|Distortion Correction| 카메라의 왜곡 보정, Native / C++ 플러그인 사용, Unity / 유니티 보정 사용
|Stereo Screen Scale|Scales the resolution of the #StereoScreen.  Set to less than 1.0 to increase rendering speed while decreasing sharpness, or greater than 1.0 to do the opposite.
|Neck Model Scale|  /// The native SDK will apply a neck offset to the head tracking, resulting in/// a more realistic model of a person's head position.  This control determines  /// the scale factor of the offset.  To turn off the neck model, set it to 0, and  /// to turn it all on, set to 1.  Intermediate values can be used to animate from  /// on to off or vice versa.
